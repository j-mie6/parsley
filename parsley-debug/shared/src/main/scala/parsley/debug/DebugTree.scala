  * Initially unpopulated, it will be populated with information regarding the parser, such as
  * what it is (if it is a primitive such as `parsley.internal.deepembedding.singletons.Pure`,
  * or a user-defined named parser if names are collected) as the parser itself runs on some input.
  *
  * Any tree node will store the input it has parsed (or attempted to parse) as well as its
  * success state as an optional [[ParseAttempt]] instance.
  *
  * Although this trait is unsealed, it is not useful to make a subtype of this trait, as this
  * trait's sole purpose is to provide safe methods into handling the frozen trees produced by
