  * This is the class that encapsulates the act of parsing and running an object of this class with `parse` will

  *
  * @note In order to construct an object of this class you must use the combinators; the class itself is opaque.
  *
  * @author Jamie Willis
  * @version 4.0.0
  *
  * @groupprio run 0
  * @groupname run Running Parsers
  * @groupdesc run These methods allow for a parser to be executed.
  *
  * @groupprio map 20
  * @groupname map Result Changing Combinators
  * @groupdesc map
  *     These combinators change the result of the parser they are called on into a value
  *     of a different type. This new result value may or may not be derived from the previous
  *     result.
  *
  * @groupprio alt 25
  * @groupname alt Branching Combinators
  * @groupdesc alt
  *     These combinators allow for parsing one alternative or another. All of these combinators
  *     are ''left-biased'', which means that the left-hand side of the combinator is tried first:
  *     the right-hand side of the combinator will only be tried when the left-hand one failed
  *     (and did not consume input in the process).
  *
  * @groupprio seq 25
  * @groupname seq Sequencing Combinators
  * @groupdesc seq
  *     These combinators all combine two parsers in sequence. The receiver of the combinator
  *     will be executed first, then the argument second. The results of both parsers are combined
  *     in some way (depending on the individual combinator). If one of the parsers fails, the
  *     combinator as a whole fails.
  *
  * @groupprio filter 50
  * @groupname filter Filtering Combinators
  * @groupdesc filter
  *     These combinators perform filtering on the results of a parser. This means that, given
  *     the result of a parser, they will perform some function on that result, and the success
  *     of that function effects whether or not the parser fails.
  *
  * @groupprio fold 50
  * @groupname fold Folding Combinators
  * @groupdesc fold
  *     These combinators repeatedly execute a parser (at least zero or one times depending on
  *     the specific combinator) until it fails. The results of the successes are then combined
  *     together using a folding function. An initial value for the accumulation may be given
  *     (for the `fold`s), or the first successful result is the initial accumulator (for the
  *     `reduce`s). These are implemented efficiently and do not need to construct any intermediate
  *     list with which to store the results.
  *
  * @groupprio monad 75
  * @groupname monad Expensive Sequencing Combinators
  * @groupdesc monad
  *     These combinators can sequence two parsers, where the first parser's result influences
  *     the structure of the second one. This may be because the second parser is generated
  *     from the result of the first, or that the first parser ''returns'' the second parser.
  *     Either way, the second parser cannot be known until runtime, when the first parser
  *     has been executed: this means that Parsley is forced to compile the second parser during
  *     parse-time, which is '''very''' expensive to do repeatedly. These combinators are only
  *     needed in exceptional circumstances, and should be avoided otherwise.
  *
  * @groupprio special 100
  * @groupname special Special Methods
  * @groupdesc special These are methods that should be rarely needed.
  *
  * @define attemptreason
  *     The reason for this behaviour is that it prevents space leaks and improves error messages. If this behaviour
  *     is not desired, use `atomic(this)` to rollback any input consumed on failure.
  *
  * @define or
  *     parses `q` if this parser fails '''without''' consuming input.
  *
  *     If this parser is successful, then this combinator is successful and no further action is taken. Otherwise, if this parser
  *     fails '''without''' consuming input, then `q` is parsed instead. If this parser fails having consumed
  *     input, this combinator fails.
  *
  * @define orconst
  *     returns `x` if this parser fails '''without''' consuming input.
  *
  *     If this parser is successful, then this combinator is successful and no further action is taken. Otherwise, if this parser
  *     fails '''without''' consuming input, then `x` is unconditionally returned. If this parser fails having consumed
  *     input, this combinator fails. Functionally the same as `this <|> pure(x)`.
  *
  * @define bind
  *     first performs this parser, then uses its result to generate and execute a new parser.
  *
  *     First, this combinator runs this parser. If it succeeded, the result `x` is given to the function `f`
  *     to produce a new parser `f(x)`. This new parser is then executed and its result returned. If either
  *     of this parser or the new parser fails, then the entire combinator fails.
  *
  *     This is a very powerful combinator (Turing-powerful, in fact): it is only necessary (and not ''all''
  *     the time) to use this for context-sensitive parsing. The idea is that it can make any form of
  *     decision based on the result of a parser, allowing it to perform a different parser for each
  *     possible output of another without exhaustively enumerating them all.
  *
  * @define autoAmend
  *     when this combinator fails (and not this parser itself), it will generate errors rooted at the start of the
  *     parse (as if [[parsley.errors.combinator$.amend `amend`]] had been used) and the caret will span the entire
  *     successful parse of this parser.

      * This is a very powerful combinator (Turing-powerful, in fact): it is only necessary (and not ''all''
      * the time) to use this for context-sensitive parsing. The idea is that it can allow a parser to return
      * any other parser as its result: this allows for an implementation of a later parser to be picked
      * by an earlier one.
      *
      * ''In Haskell, this combinator is known as `join`''.
      *
      * @example imagine a parser for RegEx that first reads the description of the regular expression, then runs
      *          that against the remaining input string. It is possible to implement the parser for the regular
      *          expression itself as a `Parsley[Parsley[Unit]]`, which returns a parser that matches the regular
      *          expression. This can then be used to parse the remaining input by using `flatten` to incorporate
      *          it into the parser again:
      * {{{
      * scala> val regexDesc: Parsley[Parsley[Unit]] = ..
      * // let's suppose "#" is the delimeter between expression and input
      * scala> val regex: Parsley[Unit] = (regexDesc <* char('#')).flatten
      * scala> regex.parse("a.(c*)#abccc")
      * val res0 = Success(())
      * scala> regex.parse("a.(c*)#a")
      * val res1 = Failure(..)
      * }}}
      *
      * @param ev witnesses that the result type of this parser, `A`, is really `Parsley[B]`.
      * @return a new parser, which sequences this parser with its result parser.
      * @note there is '''significant''' overhead for using `flatten`: if possible try to avoid using it! This
      *       is because Parsley will need to generate, process, and compile each parser produced by the combinator
      *       during parse-time.

          * There are some combinators that are, due to Scala limitations,
          * strict in all their parameters. Usually, a combinator is strict
          * in its "first position", which is to say the first part of the
          * combinator to be executed; and lazy in all other "positions".
          * The rationale behind this is that recursion appearing in a
          * "first position" ''will'' result in infinite recursion at parse-time,
          * it is left-recursive after all, and so it makes little sense to
          * waste efficiency and complicate the API to support laziness
          * there. Since method receivers are strict and only
          * arguments can be lazy under regular conditions, this works well.
          *
          * However, for combinators that are always strict, this poses a
          * problem: a recursion point inside one of these strict fields
          * will cause an infinite loop at runtime! This can be fixed by
          * ensuring that this becomes part of a lazy argument. This is
          * a solution described by the [[combinator$.sequence `sequence`]]
          * combinator, for instance: `p <::> sequence(q, .., r)` will ensure
          * that the `sequence` is in a lazy position in `<::>` meaning that
          * even if any of `q` to `r` must be lazy, they can go in the strict
          * positions of skip because the `p <::>` provides the required
          * laziness. However, if this isn't possible (for instance, with
          * the [[syntax.zipped$ `zipped`]] combinators), then how can
          * this problem be solved?
          *
          * This is the job of the `~` combinator: very simply it wraps up
          * a parser in a lazy box, so that even if the box is forced by
          * a strict position, the parser will remain lazy. This means it
          * serves as an adequate solution to this problem.
          *
          * @example {{{
          * // this works fine, even though all of `zipped`'s parsers are strict
