/** This extractor mixin provides an implementation for
  * [[parsley.errors.ErrorBuilder.unexpectedToken `ErrorBuilder.unexpectedToken`]] when mixed into
  * an error builder: it will try and parse the residual input to identify a valid lexical token
  * to report.
  *
  * When parsing a grammar that as a dedicated lexical distinction, it is nice to be able to report
  * problematic tokens relevant to that grammar as opposed to generic input lifted straight from the
  * input stream. The easiest way of doing this would be having a pre-lexing pass and parsing based
  * on tokens, but this is deliberately not how Parsley is designed. Instead, this extractor can
  * try and parse the remaining input to try and identify a token on demand.
  *
  * If the `lexicalError` flag of the `unexpectedToken` method is not set, which would indicate a
  * problem within a token reported by a classical lexer and not the parser, the extractor will
  * try to parse each of the provided `tokens` in turn: whichever is the longest matched of these
  * tokens will be reported as the problematic one (this can be changed by overriding `selectToken`).
  * For best effect, these tokens should not consume
  * whitespace (which would otherwise be included at the end of the token!): this means that, if
  * using the `Lexer` class, the functionality in '''`nonlexeme`''' should be used. If one of the
  * givens tokens cannot be parsed, the input until the ''next'' valid parsable token (or end of input)
  * is returned as a `Token.Raw`.
  *
  * Currently, if `lexicalError` is true, this extractor will just return the next character
  * as the problematic item (this may be changed by overriding the `extractItem` method).
  *
  * @since 4.0.0

      *       trailing (and certainly not leading) whitespace: if using definitions from
