/** This class can be used to generate hand-tuned error messages without using `flatMap`.

  * a previous parser to form an error message and then raise it. This is not something that
  * is normally possible with raw combinators, without using `flatMap`, which is expensive.
  *
  * Primarily, these are designed to be used with `filterWith`/`verifiedWith`/`preventWith`
  * but can be used in other parsers as well. See the methods of the class for information.
