/** This module contains all the functionality and operations for using and manipulating references.
  *
  * These often have a role in performing context-sensitive parsing tasks, where a Turing-powerful
  * system is required. While `flatMap` is capable of such parsing, it is much less efficient
  * than the use of references, though slightly more flexible. In particular, the `persist` combinator
  * enabled by `StateCombinators` can serve as a drop-in replacement for `flatMap` in many scenarios.
  *
  * @since 4.5.0
  *
  * @groupprio ref 0
  * @groupname ref References
  * @groupdesc ref
  *     The `Ref` type is used to describe pieces of state that are threaded through a parser.
  *     The creation and basic combinators of references are found within `Ref` and its companion
  *     object.
  *
  * @groupprio comb 5
  * @groupname comb Reference-Based Combinators
  * @groupdesc comb
  *     Some combinators are made much more efficient in the presence of references and they can
  *     be found here.
  *
  * @groupprio ext 10
  * @groupname ext Reference Extension Combinators
  * @groupdesc ext
  *     These are implicit classes that, when in scope, enable additional combinators on
  *     parsers that interact with the reference system in some way.
