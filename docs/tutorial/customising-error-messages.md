# Customising Error Messages
Previously, in [Effective Lexing]
we saw how we could extend our parsers to handle whitespace and lexing. In this wiki post we'll finally address
error messages. Thoughout all the other entries in this series I have neglected to talk about error
messages at all, but they are a very important part of a parser.

# Adjusting Error Content
I'm going to start with the parser from last time, but before we introduced the `Lexer` class. The
reason for this is that the `Lexer` functionality has error messages baked into it, which means this
post would be even shorter! It's not perfect, however, but it does make some good error messages for
your basic lexemes. There is nothing stopping you from using the techniques here to change those
messages if you wish though. Simply put: the original grammar has more room for exploration for us.

```scala mdoc
import parsley.Parsley, Parsley.atomic

object lexer {
    import parsley.Parsley.{eof, many}
    import parsley.character.{digit, whitespace, string, item, endOfLine}
    import parsley.combinator.manyTill

    private def symbol(str: String) = atomic(string(str)).void
    private implicit def implicitSymbol(tok: String) = symbol(tok)

    private val lineComment = "//" ~> manyTill(item, endOfLine).void
    private val multiComment = "/*" ~> manyTill(item, "*/").void
    private val comment = lineComment | multiComment
    private val skipWhitespace = many(whitespace.void | comment).void

    private def lexeme[A](p: =>Parsley[A]) = p <~ skipWhitespace
    private def token[A](p: =>Parsley[A]) = lexeme(atomic(p))
    def fully[A](p: =>Parsley[A]): Parsley[A] = skipWhitespace ~> p <~ eof

    val number: Parsley[BigInt] =
        token(digit.foldLeft1[BigInt](0)((n, d) => n * 10 + d.asDigit))

    object implicits {
        implicit def implicitSymbol(s: String): Parsley[Unit] = lexeme(symbol(s))
    }
}

object expressions {
    import parsley.expr.{precedence, Ops, InfixL}

    import lexer.implicits.implicitSymbol
    import lexer.{number, fully}

    private lazy val atom: Parsley[BigInt] = "(" ~> expr <~ ")" | number
    private lazy val expr = precedence[BigInt](atom)(
        Ops(InfixL)("*" as (_ * _)),
        Ops(InfixL)("+" as (_ + _), "-" as (_ - _)))

    val parser = fully(expr)
    def parse(input: String) = parser.parse(input)
}
```

So, before, we saw how this ran on succesful cases. Let's now start to see how it works on _bad_
input.

```scala mdoc:to-string
expressions.parse("5d")
```

Let's start by breaking this error down first and understanding what the components of it are and
why this information has appeared. The first line of the error reports the line and column number
of the message (in Parsley hard tabs are treated as aligning to the nearest 4th column). If you are
using `parseFromFile` then this will also display the filename. The last two lines always show the
location at which the error occured. This is going to be _the point_ at which the error that
eventually ended up being reported occured, _not_ necessarily where the parser ended up. This can
be improved in the future. Next you can see the _unexpected_ and _expected_ clauses. The unexpected
"d" here is telling us roughly what we already knew. The expected clause on the other hand tells us
all the things we could have used to fix our problem. There is definitely a lot of noise here though.

First let's just make sure we understand where each of these alternatives came from. Firstly, it's
clear that since the last thing we read was a 5, a good way of carrying on would be reading another
digit to make the number bigger. We could also read a space or start a comment as a way of making
more progress too. Of course, another way we could make progress would have been using one of the
operators and in the process continued our expression. Finally we could simply remove the d and it
would run perfectly fine. Notice how `(` and `)` are not suggested as alternatives despite appearing
in the parser: `5(` or `5)` makes no sense either. As another small example, let's see what happens
to the error if we add a space between the 5 and the d.

```scala mdoc:to-string
expressions.parse("5 d")
```

Neat, so this time round `digit` is no longer a valid alternative: clearly the number has come to
an end because we wrote a space. But the other possibilities from before are still valid. So, how
can we start making improvements? There are seven core combinators available to us for this purpose:

* `.label` or `?` is the most common combinator you'll be using. It influences the way an _expected_
  behaves for the parser it annotates. Importantly, if the parser it is annotating failed _and_
  consumed input in the process, then the label will not be applied. We'll see an example of why
  this is useful later.
* `fail` is useful, but a bit of a sledgehammer. When `fail` (or any of its derivative combinators
  like `guardAgainst`) is used, it removes the unexpected and expected information and just replaces it
  with a given message. If there are multiple `fail`s that appear in the same message, they are
  each written on a newline.
* `unexpected` is the least commonly used combinator in practice. When it is used, it will,
  like `fail`, immediately fails except it reports a custom unexpected message. Currently, only
  one unexpected message can be present in the error at once, so this is not very useful unless you
  really know what you are doing.
* `.hide` is a method that removes the output of a parser from the error.
* `.explain` is a method that can provide _reasons_ for a parser's failure. If the parser can recover
  and move onto other alternatives, the reasons may be lost. But they can still be quite nice when
  used in the correct place!
* `amend` and `entrench` are a pair of combinators that work together to correct the position of
  some error messages. These are quite rare in practice.

All of these can be found in the `parsley.errors.combinator` module.

```scala mdoc:reset:invisible
// welcome to the mad house, we need to do it this way to "hide behind"
// the curtain
import parsley.Parsley, Parsley.{atomic, many}
import parsley.character.{digit, whitespace, string, item, endOfLine}
import parsley.combinator.manyTill

def symbol(str: String) = atomic(string(str))
implicit def implicitSymbol(tok: String) = symbol(tok)

val lineComment = "//" ~> manyTill(item, endOfLine).void
val multiComment = "/*" ~> manyTill(item, "*/").void
val comment = lineComment | multiComment
val skipWhitespace = many(whitespace.void | comment).void

def lexeme[A](p: =>Parsley[A]) = p <~ skipWhitespace
def token[A](p: =>Parsley[A]) = lexeme(atomic(p))

def mkNumber(digit: Parsley[Char], ws: Parsley[Unit]): Parsley[BigInt] =
    atomic(digit.foldLeft1[BigInt](0)((n, d) => n * 10 + d.asDigit)) <~ ws

def mkExpressions(number: Parsley[BigInt], whiteSpace: Parsley[Unit]) = new {
    import parsley.Parsley.eof
    import parsley.expr.{precedence, Ops, InfixL}

    private implicit def implicitSymbol(str: String): Parsley[Unit] =
        symbol(str) ~> whiteSpace

    private lazy val atom: Parsley[BigInt] = "(" ~> expr <~ ")" | number
    private lazy val expr = precedence[BigInt](atom)(
        Ops(InfixL)("*" as (_ * _)),
        Ops(InfixL)("+" as (_ + _), "-" as (_ - _)))

    def parse(input: String) = (whiteSpace ~> expr <~ eof).parse(input)
}
```

## Using `label`
From this section, we are only going to be using `label` and `hide`, as they are by far the most useful
and effective of the five methods. That being said, `explain` can be _very_ useful, but we'll find
there are no compelling use-cases for it in this example. Let's start off by giving a label to
`comment` and see what happens:

```scala mdoc:nest:silent
import parsley.errors.combinator._

val comment = (lineComment | multiComment).label("comment")
```
```scala mdoc:invisible
val skipWhitespace = many(whitespace.void | comment).void
val expressions = mkExpressions(mkNumber(digit, skipWhitespace), skipWhitespace)
```

Now let's run our parser from before:

```scala mdoc:to-string
expressions.parse("5d")
```

Nice! So, if you compare the two, you'll notice that `"/*"` and `"//"` both disappeared from the
message, but `comment` was added. You can tell when `label` is being used because there are not
quotes surrounding the items. Knowing this, you can probably guess that `digit`, `eof`, and
`whitespace` all have error labels of their own.

### Using `hide` to trim away junk
This is a good start, but normally we might say
that whitespace suggestions in an error message are normally just noise: of course we expect to be
able to write whitespace in places, it's not _usually_ the solution to someone's problem. This makes
it a good candidate for the `hide` combinator:

```scala mdoc:silent:nest
import parsley.errors.combinator._

val skipWhitespace = many(whitespace.void | comment).void.hide
```
```scala mdoc:invisible
val expressions = mkExpressions(mkNumber(digit, skipWhitespace), skipWhitespace)
```

Now let's check again:

```scala mdoc:to-string
expressions.parse("5d")
```

Great! The `hide` combinator has removed the information from the error message, and now it's
looking a lot cleaner. But what if we started writing a comment, what would happen then?

```scala mdoc:to-string
expressions.parse("5/*")
```

So, as I mentioned earlier, `hide` is just a `label`, and `label` will not relabel something if it
fails and consumes input. That means, by opening our comment but not _finishing_ it, we can see
some different suggestions. In this case, end of input is not allowed, and any character will work
to extend the comment, but clearly `*/` is a way to properly end it. Let's add a label to that,
however, to make it a bit friendlier:

```scala mdoc:silent:nest
val lineComment = "//" *> manyTill(item, endOfLine.label("end of comment")).void
val multiComment = "/*" *> manyTill(item, "*/".label("end of comment")).void
```
```scala mdoc:invisible
import parsley.errors.combinator._

val comment = (lineComment | multiComment).label("comment")
val skipWhitespace = many(whitespace.void | comment).void.hide
val expressions = mkExpressions(mkNumber(digit, skipWhitespace), skipWhitespace)
```

Now we get a more informative error message of:

```scala mdoc:to-string
expressions.parse("5/*")
```

Great! Now let's turn our attention back to expressions and not whitespace.

### Labelling our numbers
Let's take a look at a very simple bad input and see how we can improve on it:

```scala mdoc:to-string
expressions.parse("d")
```

So this time, we can see two possible ways of resolving this error are opening brackets, or a
`digit`. Now `digit` is really a poor name here, what we really mean is `integer` or `number`:

```scala mdoc:invisible
def token[A](p: Parsley[A]): Parsley[A] = atomic(p) <~ skipWhitespace
```
```scala mdoc:silent:nest
val number =
    token(digit.foldLeft1[BigInt](0)((n, d) => n * 10 + d.asDigit)).label("number")
```
```scala mdoc:invisible
val expressions = mkExpressions(number, skipWhitespace)
```

Now we get, the following, nicer error message:

```scala mdoc:to-string
expressions.parse("d")

expressions.parse("5x")
```

But notice in the second error message, again we have been given `digit` and not `number` as our
alternative. This is good, once we've started reading a number by reading `5` it would be
inappropriate to suggest a number as a good next step. But `digit` here is not particularly descriptive
and we can do better still:

```scala mdoc:silent:nest
val number =
    token(
        digit.label("end of number").foldLeft1[BigInt](0)((n, d) => n * 10 + d.asDigit)
    ).label("number")
```
```scala mdoc:invisible
val expressions = mkExpressions(number, skipWhitespace)
```

This gives us, again, a much nicer message:

```scala mdoc:to-string
expressions.parse("5x")
```

### Merging multiple labels
With an example grammar as small as this, I think we are almost done here! The last thing we could
improve is the repetition of `"*"`, `"+"`, and `"-"`. Really, we know that there is nothing special
about any of them individually, so we could more concisely replace this them with `arithmetic operator`,
or since we only have arithmetic operators here `operator` will do. we don't need to do anything
special here, when multiple labels are encountered with the same name, they will only appear once!

```scala mdoc:nest:invisible
import parsley.Parsley.eof
import parsley.expr.{precedence, Ops, InfixL}

implicit def implicitSymbol(str: String): Parsley[Unit] = symbol(str) ~> skipWhitespace

lazy val atom: Parsley[BigInt] = "(" ~> expr <~ ")" | number
```

```scala mdoc:silent
lazy val expr = precedence[BigInt](atom)(
  Ops(InfixL)("*".label("operator") as (_ * _)),
  Ops(InfixL)("+".label("operator") as (_ + _), "-".label("operator") as (_ - _)))
```

```scala mdoc:invisible
val expressions = new {
    def parse(input: String) = (skipWhitespace ~> expr <~ eof).parse(input)
}
```

Now we arrive at our final form:

```scala mdoc:to-string
expressions.parse("5x")

expressions.parse(" 67 + ")
```

Great! Now obviously you could take this even further and make `"("` become `opening parenthesis`
or something, but I don't really feel that adds much.

## Wrapping up the Expression Example
Hopefully, you get a sense of how much of an
art form and subjective writing good error messages is, but Parsley provides decent error messages
out of the box (now based on `megaparsec`'s error messages from Haskell). It doesn't have to be hard
though, so just play around and see what feels right. I would say, however, there is an interesting
phenomenon in the programming languages and compilers community:
**compiler writers write error messages that are tailored for compiler writers**. It's an
interesting problem when you think about it: the person who writes error messages is a compiler
expert, and so they often rely on the concepts they understand. That means they are more prone to
including the names of stuff in the grammar to describe syntax problems, and so on. While this is
great for experts and compiler writers, it seemingly forgets people who are new to programming or
this "grammar" in particular. That can make error messages needlessly intimidating for the average
Joe. The take home from this is to try and avoid labelling `expr` with `.label("expression")`,
because that just ends up making something that is no longer useful or informative:

```scala mdoc:nest:invisible
val expressions = new {
    def parse(input: String) =
        (skipWhitespace ~> expr.label("expression") <~ eof).parse(input)
}
```

```scala mdoc:to-string
expressions.parse("")
```

What use is that to anybody? The same idea applies to statements, and various other abstract
grammatical notions. Something like
`"expected if statement, while loop, for loop, variable declaration, or assignment"` is so much more
meaningful than `"expected statement"`. I would ask that you keep that in mind 🙂. To conclude our
work with this parser, here is the full code of the finished product. Obviously, with the
`Lexer`, some of this work is already done, but you can still apply the lessons learnt here to the
wider parser!

```scala mdoc:reset
import parsley.Parsley, Parsley.{atomic, eof, many}
import parsley.errors.combinator._

object lexer {
    import parsley.character.{digit, whitespace, string, item, endOfLine}
    import parsley.combinator.manyTill

    private def symbol(str: String) = atomic(string(str)).void
    private implicit def implicitSymbol(tok: String) = symbol(tok)

    private val lineComment = "//" ~> manyTill(item, endOfLine).void.label("end of comment")
    private val multiComment = "/*" ~> manyTill(item, "*/").void.label("end of comment")
    private val comment = (lineComment | multiComment).label("comment")
    private val skipWhitespace = many(whitespace.void | comment).void.hide

    private def lexeme[A](p: =>Parsley[A]) = p <~ skipWhitespace
    private def token[A](p: =>Parsley[A]) = lexeme(atomic(p))
    def fully[A](p: =>Parsley[A]): Parsley[A] = skipWhitespace ~> p <~ eof

    val number: Parsley[BigInt] = token {
        digit.label("end of number").foldLeft1[BigInt](0)((n, d) => n * 10 + d.asDigit)
    }.label("number")

    object implicits {
        implicit def implicitSymbol(s: String): Parsley[Unit] = lexeme(symbol(s))
    }
}

object expressions {
    import parsley.expr.{precedence, Ops, InfixL}

    import lexer.implicits.implicitSymbol
    import lexer.{number, fully}

    private lazy val atom: Parsley[BigInt] = "(" ~> expr <~ ")" | number
    private lazy val expr = precedence[BigInt](atom)(
        Ops(InfixL)("*".label("operator") as (_ * _)),
        Ops(InfixL)("+".label("operator") as (_ + _), "-".label("operator") as (_ - _)))

    val parser = fully(expr)
    def parse(input: String) = parser.parse(input)
}
```

## Using `explain`
So far, we've seen how `label` can be used to clean up error messages and make them much more
presentable and informative. Another way of achieving this is by using the `explain` combinator.
Unlike `label` this is much more freeform and when used properly can be _incredibly_ effective.
Essentially, with `explain` you are leveraging your own knowledge about the context you are in
to provide a much more tailored and hand-crafted message to the user. It can be used to both provide
an additional hint in an otherwise poor message or to enrich the error with suggestions for how the
error might be fixed.

Using it is just as easy as using `label` and you can't really go wrong with it: other than being a
bit... too descriptive. Again, the `Lexer` class already makes use of this technique to improve its
own error messages, but let's suppose we wanted to write some of its functionality ourselves. Let's
cook up a string literal parser, supporting some (limited) escape sequences.

```scala mdoc:reset:silent
import parsley.Parsley
import parsley.syntax.character.charLift
import parsley.combinator.choice
import parsley.character._
import parsley.errors.combinator._

val escapeChar =
    choice('n' as '\n', 't' as '\t', '\"', '\\')
val stringLetter =
    noneOf('\"', '\\').label("string character") |
    ('\\' ~> escapeChar).label("escape character")

val stringLiteral =
    ('\"' ~> stringOfMany(stringLetter) <~ '\"'.label("end of string")).label("string")
```

Let's start with something like this. If we run a couple of examples, we can see where it performs
well and where it performs less well:

```scala mdoc:to-string
stringLiteral.parse("")

stringLiteral.parse("\"")

stringLiteral.parse("\"\\a")
```

So, for the first two cases, the error message performs quite well. But the last message is a bit
noisy. One possible approach to improve this could be to label each alternative to give them a
slightly clearer name, which would result in something like:

```scala mdoc:nest:invisible
def mkString(escapeChar: Parsley[Char]) = {
    val stringLetter =
        noneOf('\"', '\\').label("string character") |
        ('\\' ~> escapeChar).label("escape character")

    ('\"' ~> stringOfMany(stringLetter) <~ '\"'.label("end of string")).label("string")
}
val escapeChar =
    choice('n'.label("\\n") as '\n', 't'.label("\\t") as '\t',
           '\"'.label("\\\""), '\\'.label("\\\\"))
val stringLiteral = mkString(escapeChar)
```

```scala mdoc:to-string
stringLiteral.parse("\"\\a")
```

This is _better_, but a bit misleading, we don't expect a `\`! Now, you could instead opt to remove
the backslashes, but then that doesn't give much information about why these things are expected.
Another option would be to label all alternatives with some common name:

```scala mdoc:nest:silent
val escapeChar =
    choice('n' as '\n', 't' as '\t', '\"', '\\')
        .label("end of escape sequence")
```
```scala mdoc:invisible
val stringLiteral = mkString(escapeChar)
```

Which would yield

```scala mdoc:to-string
stringLiteral.parse("\"\\a")
```

This is a bit more helpful, in that it does provide a good name to what we expected. But at the same
time it doesn't help the user to understand how to fix their problem: "what is an escape sequence".
This is similar to the "statement" problem I described above. In this case, (and indeed in the
"statement" case), we can add an `explain` to help the user understand what we mean:

```scala mdoc:nest:silent
val escapeChar =
    choice('n' as '\n', 't' as '\t', '\"', '\\')
        .label("end of escape sequence")
        .explain("valid escape sequences include \\n, \\t, \\\", or \\\\")
```
```scala mdoc:invisible
val stringLiteral = mkString(escapeChar)
```

The `explain` combinator annotates failure messages with an additional reason. These can stack, and
are displayed each on their own line in the error message. With this in place, let's see what the
new error message is:

```scala mdoc:to-string
stringLiteral.parse("\"\\a")
```

This time, we keep the name of the expected token clear and concise, but we _also_ help the user to
understand what this actually means. The error isn't misleading in the sense that we aren't
suggesting that a `\n` would fix the parse error _after_ the `\` we already wrote, but have have
said that we expect the end of the escape as well as demonstrated what that would look like. This
is great!

There isn't much more to say about the `explain` combinator than that really. Hopefully this already
gives you a sense of how useful it can be. Like I mentioned before, the poor error problem that
compiler writers often suffer from can be nicely solved using `explain`. For instance, a message like
"... expected statement ... valid statements include 'if statements', 'loops', or 'assignments'" is
subjectively better than both of the alternatives (namely "expected statement" or the one that lists
out every single alternative). This has the benefits of both worlds: for an experienced user, the error
message gets straight to the point, and for the newcomer, the error message provides a bit more
information that can help them learn the terminology.

# Adjusting Error Formatting

As we've seen in this post, the error messages produced by parsley are fairly readable. They are
broken into two kinds: "vanilla" errors built up of "expected", "unexpected", and "reason" clauses;
and "specialised" errors built up solely of "message" clauses. So far, we have only seen examples of
the "vanilla" errors, and we will see the "specialised" errors in the next post. These have been
so far formatted using Parsley's default mechanism, which creates an error as a string. This is ok
for basic use, but in projects where there is some pre-existing error format, then maintaining consistency
across error messages is much harder without _parsing_ the resulting `String` errors to extract
their content: this is, frankly, ridiculous to expect! Moreover, suppose you wanted to unit test
your parser in both successful and failing cases, then performing raw string comparision is really
brittle, especially if Parsley adjusts the format slightly!

Luckily, Parsley 3.0.0 introduced an abstraction layer between the error messages that the parsers
work with and the final resulting error message. This means that actually, the error message format
is not only configurable, but doesn't _have_ to be a `String`! The final part of this post is dedicated
to understanding how to work with this mechanism, using Parsley's own unit test formatter as an example.

Firstly, I want to give examples of both types of format, and annotate the names given to each part
of them:

```

As you can see, the content for a specialised error is (ironically) plainer than a vanilla message.
This means that the errors are much more customisable from the parser side, but it is less rich
in parser generated information than the vanilla is. Hopefully you can see that both error messages
still have a _very_ similar shape other than the error info lines themselves. In both cases, and not
shown by the diagrams, the main contents of the error -- either unexpected, expected, reasons, and
line info; or messages and line info -- are called "error info lines".

For vanilla errors, notice that the unexpected and expected lines make references to raw, named, and
end of input: these are collectively known as _items_. The `.label` combinator produces named items,
the `eof` combinator produces the end of input item, and unlabelled combinators produce raw items.

Together, all these components are referenced (by these names!) by the `ErrorBuilder` trait. The way
it works is that a concrete `ErrorBuilder` has to be provided to the `.parse` method of a parser,
and when the parser has finished failing, the builder is used to construct the final error message,
converting the internal representation that Parsley uses into the desired output specified by the
builder: you can think of it like a conversation. The internals of Parsley take a portion of the
information it has, and talks to the builder how to format it into another intermediate form; it then
will feed this new information into another method of the builder after possibly more collection.
To allow all of this plumbing to be fed together and maintain maximum flexiblity to the user, the
builder makes use of "associated types". Let's take a look at the definition of `ErrorBuilder` without
all the sub-formatters to understand what I mean:

```scala
trait ErrorBuilder[Err] {
    // This is the top level function which takes all the sub-parts
    // and combines them into the final `Err`
    def build(pos: Position, source: Source, lines: ErrorInfoLines): Err

    type Position
    type Source
    type ErrorInfoLines
    type ExpectedItems
    type Messages
    type UnexpectedLine
    type ExpectedLine
    type Message
    type LineInfo
    type Item
    type Raw <: Item
    type Named <: Item
    type EndOfInput <: Item

    ...
}
```

Wow, that's a lot of types! Essentially, each concrete implementation of this trait must specify
what each of those types are. This means that the representation of the error is as flexible as
possible. In the `build` method, you can see that the types `Position`, `Source`, and
`ErrorInfoLines` are all referenced. Indeed, you can also see these marked on _both_ diagrams: in
other words, `build` is responsible for the general shape of _both_ types of error message.

To understand how these might come about, let's take a step "into" the formatter to find the sources
of values for `Position`, `Source`, and `ErrorInfoLines`:

```scala
trait ErrorBuilder[Err] {
    ...

    def pos(line: Int, col: Int): Position
    def source(sourceName: Option[String]): Source

    def vanillaError(unexpected: UnexpectedLine, expected: ExpectedLine,
                     reasons: Messages, line: LineInfo): ErrorInfoLines
    def specialisedError(msgs: Messages, line: LineInfo): ErrorInfoLines

    ...
}
```

Hopefully, you can start to see how this might be structured:

* To get a `Position` value for the final error message, the line and column information is fed
  _straight_ from the parser into the `pos` method, which can then hand back the "formatted" position.
* To get the `Source` name, the filename (if it exists!) is fed into the `source` method, which can
  then be fed into `format` by the internals of Parsley.
* To collect up all the `ErrorInfoLines` there are two possible approaches depending on whether the
  error is vanilla or specialised. In both cases, the relevant information is passed in and can be
  "formatted" into whatever `ErrorInfoLines` is: for instance, the default in Parsley has
  `type ErrorInfoLines = Seq[String]`. Neither of these two methods take raw information from the
  parser, they have clearly been fed through another part of the formatter, given their types.

I won't continue traversing deeper and deeper into the system, because it's just going to be the
same idea over and over again. But I will note all the "terminal" methods that do take information
directly from the parser:

```scala
trait ErrorBuilder[Err] {
    ...

    def pos(line: Int, col: Int): Position
    def source(sourceName: Option[String]): Source

    def reason(reason: String): Message
    def message(msg: String): Message
    def lineInfo(line: String, linesBefore: Seq[String],
                 linesAfter: Seq[String], errorPointsAt: Int): LineInfo
    val numLinesBefore: Int
    val numLinesAfter: Int

    def raw(item: String): Raw
    def named(item: String): Named
    val endOfInput: EndOfInput

    def unexpectedToken(cs: Iterable[Char], amountOfInputParserWanted: Int,
                        lexicalError: Boolean): Token
}
```

The two attributes `numLinesBefore` and `numLinesAfter` are used by the Parsley internals to decide
how many raw lines of input both before and after the problematic line to provide to `lineInfo`. In
a pinch, overriding these values from `DefaultErrorBuilder` is a quick way of changing how specific
your errors are to other lines in the input. The `unexpectedToken` method is
special, but I'll leave a discussion of this [another page](../api-guide/errors/tokenextractors.md). All of the other methods in the `ErrorBuilder` will make
use of the refined results from the methods above.

I hope that, by this point, you have a reasonable idea of how this system all ties together. But, if
you don't, or you want an example, take a look at how `parsley`'s own unit tests format error
messages to be easier to pattern match on and test against, the implementation can be found [here][Constructing Test Errors].
